# PipelineLab - Development Plan with Extended Thinking

## 🎯 Project Philosophy
**"The Inspect Element for RAG"** - Making the invisible visible through visual debugging of RAG pipelines

## 🧠 Extended Thinking Approach
We'll use Claude's extended thinking capability to:
1. **Deep technical analysis** before each component build
2. **Architecture decisions** with trade-off analysis
3. **Code generation** with embedded best practices
4. **Quality assurance** through systematic review

#### 1.2 Data Models & Schema
**Extended Thinking Prompt**:
```
Analyze the optimal database schema for storing:
- Pipeline configurations (nodes, edges, settings)
- Document chunks with embeddings
- Execution logs and metrics
- User preferences

Consider:

**Extended Thinking Prompt**:
```
Design a robust PDF text extraction system that:
- Preserves layout information (coordinates)
- Handles tables, images, multi-column layouts
- Extracts metadata (page numbers, sections)
- Maintains character-level positional data

Compare libraries: PyMuPDF vs pdfplumber vs pypdf
Optimize for: accuracy, speed, memory usage
```

#### 2.2 Chunking Algorithm Implementation
**Target: 10+ chunking strategies**

- [ ] Table-preserving chunking
- [ ] Heading-based hierarchical chunking
- [ ] Agentic chunking (LLM-assisted)

**Extended Thinking Prompt**:
```
For semantic chunking specifically:
- How to efficiently compute embeddings for incremental text?
- What similarity threshold works best for different document types?
- How to handle edge cases (very short/long paragraphs)?
- Caching strategy to avoid re-embedding unchanged text?
```

#### 2.3 Visualization UI

```
Design the visual encoding strategy:
- Color palette for 100+ chunks (perceptually distinct)

- Visual indicators for boundary issues (mid-sentence cuts)
- Performance optimization for 1000+ page PDFs
```

### Phase 4: AI Recommender System (Week 3)
**Extended Thinking Focus**: Heuristic design & ML-powered suggestions

#### 4.1 Document Analysis Pipeline
**Extended Thinking Prompt**:
```
Build a document classifier that detects:
- Content type: Legal, Medical, Technical, Code, Narrative
- Structure: Hierarchical, Flat, Table-heavy, Code-heavy
- Density: Sparse (tweets) vs Dense (legal contracts)
- Language: Multilingual detection
- Special elements: Tables, equations, citations

Use combination of:
- Rule-based patterns (regex, keyword matching)
- Statistical features (avg sentence length, vocabulary)
- ML models (zero-shot classification)

Optimize for: <100ms latency, high accuracy
```

#### 4.2 Recommendation Engine
**Extended Thinking Prompt**:
```
Create recommendation logic:

IF document_type == "Legal Contract":
  RECOMMEND:
    - chunk_size: 1000-1500 (preserve clauses)
    - overlap: 200 (high context retention)
    - chunker: Paragraph-based
    - embedding: text-embedding-3-large (better for complex text)
    - retrieval: Hybrid search (legal terms are keyword-sensitive)

IF document_type == "Code Documentation":
  RECOMMEND:
    - chunk_size: 500-800
    - chunker: Code-aware (preserve functions)
    - embedding: code-specific model
    - retrieval: Semantic search

Build a knowledge base of 20+ document type profiles.
Allow users to override with explanations.
```

#### 4.3 Configuration Validator
- [ ] Check for invalid node combinations
- [ ] Warn about expensive operations
- [ ] Suggest optimizations (cost/performance)
- [ ] Highlight best practices

---

### Phase 5: Evaluation & Testing (Week 4)
**Extended Thinking Focus**: Metric design & benchmarking methodology

#### 5.1 LLM-as-Judge Implementation
**Extended Thinking Prompt**:
```
Design evaluation framework:

Metrics to measure:
1. Context Relevance: Do retrieved chunks answer the query?
2. Faithfulness: Is the answer grounded in retrieved context?
3. Answer Relevance: Does the answer address the query?
4. Hallucination Rate: Any fabricated information?

Judge LLM selection:
- GPT-4o-mini: Cost-effective, fast
- Claude Sonnet: High reasoning quality
- Local model: Privacy-preserving

Evaluation prompt templates:
- Few-shot examples for calibration
- Chain-of-thought for explainability
- Structured output (JSON scores)

Cost optimization:
- Batch evaluations
- Sample-based validation (not every query)
- Caching judge responses
```

#### 5.2 A/B Testing Framework
- [ ] Side-by-side pipeline comparison
- [ ] Statistical significance testing
- [ ] Cost comparison calculator
- [ ] Latency benchmarking

#### 5.3 Test Dataset Management
