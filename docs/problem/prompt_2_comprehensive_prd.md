### 🎯 Priority 1: The Chunking Visualizer (Killer Feature)

**User Story**:
"As a RAG developer, I want to see exactly where my document is being chunked so that I can verify that important context isn't being split mid-sentence or mid-table."

**Detailed Requirements**:

1. **PDF Visual Overlay**:
   - Display uploaded PDF with original formatting preserved
   - Overlay colored rectangles showing chunk boundaries
   - Color scheme: Perceptually distinct colors for adjacent chunks
   - Opacity: 20-30% to preserve readability

2. **Interactive Chunk Inspector**:
   - Hover over chunk → highlight and show tooltip with:
     - Chunk ID and index
     - Character count and token count
     - Embedding preview (first 5 dimensions)
     - Metadata (page number, section)
   - Click on chunk → open detailed panel on the right showing:
     - Full chunk text
     - Raw embedding vector
     - Similarity to query (if testing mode)
     - Boundary analysis (does it split mid-sentence?)

3. **Boundary Issue Detection**:
   - Automatically flag problematic chunks:
     - 🔴 "Mid-sentence cut detected in Chunk 47"
     - 🟡 "Table spans Chunks 12-14"
     - 🟠 "Code block incomplete in Chunk 89"
   - Provide actionable suggestions:
     - "Increase chunk size to 800 to preserve this table"
     - "Use code-aware chunking for this document"

4. **Real-Time Preview**:
   - Slider to adjust chunk_size (100-2000) and overlap (0-500)
   - Instant re-chunking (debounced, <500ms latency)

### 🎯 Priority 3: AI Recommender System (Secret Sauce)

**User Story**:
"As a non-expert RAG developer, I want the system to analyze my document and suggest optimal chunking/embedding/retrieval strategies so that I don't waste time on trial-and-error."

**Detailed Requirements**:

1. **Document Analysis**:
   - Automatic detection on upload:
     - Document type: Legal, Medical, Technical, Code, Narrative, FAQ
     - Structure: Hierarchical (headings), Flat (prose), Table-heavy
     - Density: Word count, sentence length distribution
     - Special elements: Tables, code blocks, equations, citations
     - Language: Multilingual detection

2. **Recommendation Engine**:
   - Knowledge base of 20+ document type profiles
   - Example recommendation logic:
     ```
     IF document_type == "Legal Contract":
         RECOMMEND:
             chunking: "Paragraph-based (preserves clauses)"
             chunk_size: 1000-1500
             overlap: 200 (high context retention)
             embedding: "text-embedding-3-large" (better for complex text)
             retrieval: "Hybrid search" (legal terms are keyword-sensitive)
             reranking: "Cohere Rerank" (high accuracy)
         EXPLAIN:
             "Legal documents contain long clauses that lose meaning when split.
              Large chunks with high overlap ensure complete retrieval of contractual terms.
              Hybrid search helps with exact phrase matching for legal terminology."
     ```

3. **Explainability**:
   - For each recommendation, show:
     - "Why we suggest this": Technical reasoning
     - "Trade-offs": Cost, latency, accuracy
     - "Override if": Edge cases where this might not apply

4. **Interactive Tuning**:
   - Start with recommended config
   - Let users adjust with sliders
   - Show impact: "Increasing chunk size to 800 will reduce chunks by 23% but may lower retrieval precision by 5%"

5. **A/B Testing Assistance**:
   - "Compare recommended config vs your current config"
   - Run test queries on both
   - Show metrics side-by-side

---

### 🎯 Priority 4: A/B Testing Playground

**User Story**:
"As a RAG engineer, I want to compare two different pipeline configurations on the same test dataset so that I can make data-driven decisions about which strategy to deploy."

**Detailed Requirements**:

1. **Test Dataset Management**:
   - Upload "golden" Q&A pairs (CSV/JSON)
   - Auto-generate test questions from documents using LLM
   - Maintain version history of test datasets

2. **Split-Screen Comparison**:
   - Run two pipelines simultaneously on the same queries
   - Side-by-side results table:
     ```
     Query: "What are the payment terms?"
     
     Pipeline A (Current)          Pipeline B (Experimental)
     ───────────────────────────  ───────────────────────────
     Answer: "Net 30 days..."      Answer: "Payment within..."
     Context: Chunk 47             Context: Chunk 48, 49
     Score: 0.87                   Score: 0.92
     Latency: 245ms                Latency: 312ms
     Cost: $0.003                  Cost: $0.005
     ```

3. **Automated Evaluation**:
   - LLM-as-judge to score:
     - Context relevance (0-1)
     - Faithfulness (0-1)
     - Answer relevance (0-1)
   - Statistical significance testing
   - Winner declaration with confidence interval

4. **Metrics Dashboard**:
   - Aggregate metrics across all test queries:
     - Average accuracy
     - P95 latency
     - Total cost
     - Error rate
   - Visualizations: Bar charts, scatter plots

---

### 🎯 Priority 5: LLM-as-Judge Evaluation

**User Story**:
"As a RAG developer, I want automated quality scoring of my pipeline outputs so that I can iterate without manually reviewing every response."

**Detailed Requirements**:

1. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Context Relevance**: Do the retrieved chunks answer the query?
   - **Faithfulness**: Is the answer grounded in the retrieved context (no hallucinations)?
   - **Answer Relevance**: Does the answer address the query?
   - **Completeness**: Does the answer cover all aspects of the query?

2. **Judge LLM Configuration**:
   - Selectable models:
     - GPT-4o-mini (fast, cost-effective)
     - Claude Sonnet (high reasoning quality)
     - Llama 3.2 (local, privacy-preserving)
   - Custom evaluation prompts
   - Few-shot calibration examples

3. **Evaluation Prompt Templates**:
   ```
   [Context Relevance]
   Given:
   - Query: "{query}"
   - Retrieved Context: "{context}"
   
   Rate how relevant the context is to answering the query.
   Score: 0 (not relevant) to 1 (highly relevant)
   
   Think step-by-step:
   1. What information is needed to answer the query?
   2. Does the context contain that information?
   3. What is the coverage percentage?
   
   Output JSON:
   {
       "score": 0.85,
       "reasoning": "The context contains payment terms but misses refund policy.",
       "missing_info": ["refund policy"]
   }
   ```

4. **Cost Optimization**:
   - Batch evaluations (100 queries at once)
   - Cache evaluation results
   - Sample-based validation (evaluate 10% of queries for large datasets)
   - Use cheaper models for initial screening, expensive models for final validation

5. **Evaluation History**:
   - Track scores over time
   - Compare scores across pipeline versions
   - Alert when scores drop below threshold

## RISKS & MITIGATIONS

### Risk 1: Scope Creep
**Mitigation**: Strict MVP feature cutoff. Move "nice-to-haves" to post-MVP backlog.

### Risk 2: Performance (Large PDFs)
**Mitigation**: Implement pagination, lazy loading, and web workers for client-side processing.

### Risk 3: API Cost Explosion (LLM-as-judge)
**Mitigation**: Use GPT-4o-mini ($0.150/1M tokens) or local models. Cache evaluation results.

### Risk 4: User Adoption (Unknown Market)
**Mitigation**: Launch in AI/ML communities (Reddit r/LangChain, Discord servers). Offer free tier.

### Risk 5: Technical Debt in 4 Weeks
**Mitigation**: Prioritize clean architecture. Use TypeScript for type safety. Write tests for critical paths.

## APPENDIX

### A. Competitive Analysis
- **LangFlow**: Visual builder, but no chunking visualizer or AI recommender
- **Flowise**: Similar to LangFlow, chatbot-focused
- **LangSmith**: Observability, but requires code (no visual builder)
- **Weights & Biases**: ML experiment tracking, not RAG-specific

**PipelineLab's Edge**: Visual debugging + AI recommendations + A/B testing in one platform

### B. Technical Research Papers
- "RAG Evaluation: A Survey" (arXiv)
- "Chunking Strategies for Retrieval" (ACL 2023)
- "Semantic Search Optimization" (NeurIPS 2022)

### C. User Interview Insights
- "I wish I could see exactly where my document is being split" - AI Engineer at Startup
- "I don't know which embedding model to use for my use case" - Data Scientist
- "Re-indexing takes 2 hours every time I change chunk size" - ML Engineer at Enterprise
