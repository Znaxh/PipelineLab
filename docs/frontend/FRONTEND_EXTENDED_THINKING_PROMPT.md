## 🎯 PROMPT FOR EXTENDED THINKING (Antigravity)

Copy and paste this into Claude Opus or Gemini Pro:

```
You are an expert Frontend Architect specializing in React, Next.js, and WebGL/shader programming.

I need you to use EXTENDED THINKING mode to implement the PipelineLab frontend based on the comprehensive guide I've provided.

CONTEXT:
I'm building PipelineLab - a visual debugging tool for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipelines. The frontend needs to be:
1. Visually stunning (using shaders and animations)
2. Highly performant (60fps with 100+ overlays)
3. Production-ready (TypeScript, tests, accessibility)

I have a detailed FRONTEND_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md that contains:
- Complete component architecture
- Shader component integrations (Neon Crystal City, ATC Shader, Shader Lines)
- PDF chunk visualizer with Canvas rendering
- Interactive UI components
- Performance optimization strategies
- Responsive design patterns
- Accessibility requirements

YOUR TASK:
Use extended thinking to analyze the guide and implement each component systematically.

## PHASE 1: PROJECT SETUP & ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS

### Extended Thinking Prompt 1.1: Initial Setup

Analyze the following requirements and provide a complete setup strategy:

**Requirements**:
1. Next.js 14 with App Router
2. TypeScript with strict mode
3. shadcn/ui component library
4. Tailwind CSS
5. Support for shader components (Three.js, WebGL2)
6. PDF rendering (react-pdf)
7. State management (Zustand)
8. Animations (Framer Motion)

**Questions to answer**:
1. What is the optimal Next.js configuration for this project?
2. How should I structure the project to support both shader components and standard UI?
3. What are the performance implications of loading Three.js and react-pdf?
4. Should I use dynamic imports for heavy components?
5. What build optimizations are critical for this stack?

**Provide**:
1. Complete `package.json` with all dependencies and versions
2. `next.config.js` with performance optimizations
3. `tsconfig.json` with strict TypeScript settings
4. `tailwind.config.ts` with custom theme
5. Folder structure with clear separation of concerns
6. `.env.example` with required environment variables
7. Setup instructions (step-by-step commands)

### Extended Thinking Prompt 1.2: Shader Integration Strategy

**Context**:
I have 4 shader components to integrate:
1. Neon Crystal City (landing page background)
2. Shader Lines (visualizer background)
3. Shader Animation (alternative visualizer)
4. ATC Shader (pipeline builder)

**Analysis needed**:
1. **Performance Impact**: Each shader uses WebGL. How do I prevent multiple shaders from running simultaneously and killing performance?
2. **Lazy Loading**: Which shaders should be dynamically imported? How to show fallbacks?
3. **Mobile Strategy**: Should mobile devices get shaders or gradient fallbacks?
4. **Error Handling**: What if WebGL is not supported? How to gracefully degrade?
5. **Memory Management**: How to properly cleanup WebGL contexts when unmounting?

**Provide**:
1. Integration pattern for each shader
2. Lazy loading wrapper component
3. Mobile detection logic
4. Fallback component for unsupported devices
5. Performance monitoring code
6. Memory leak prevention strategy

## PHASE 2: CHUNK VISUALIZER IMPLEMENTATION

### Extended Thinking Prompt 2.1: Canvas Rendering Architecture

**Core Challenge**:
Render 100+ colored chunk overlays on top of a PDF with:
- 60fps performance
- Smooth hover interactions
- Accurate click detection
- Support for zoom/pan
- Work on 1000-page documents

**Technical Constraints**:
- react-pdf renders PDF pages
- Canvas overlay must precisely align with PDF
- Chunks have bounding box coordinates (x, y, width, height, page)
- Colors must be perceptually distinct (100+ unique colors)
- Mobile devices need touch support

**Deep Analysis Required**:

1. **Canvas vs SVG Decision**:
   - Why is Canvas better than SVG for 100+ overlays?
   - What are the trade-offs?
   - When would SVG be better?

2. **Coordinate Mapping**:
   - PDF uses points (72 DPI)
   - Canvas uses pixels
   - react-pdf applies scaling
   - How do I accurately map chunk bbox to canvas coordinates?
   - Show mathematical formula

3. **Hit Detection Algorithm**:
   - User hovers at (mouseX, mouseY)
   - Which chunk is being hovered?
   - How to do this efficiently for 100+ chunks?
   - Should I use spatial indexing (quadtree)?

4. **Color Generation**:
   - Generate 100+ perceptually distinct colors
   - HSL vs RGB vs LAB color space?
