# PipelineLab Implementation Guide
## Using Extended Thinking for Production-Quality Development

---

## 🎯 Philosophy

This guide uses Claude's extended thinking capability to ensure every component is:
- **Architecturally sound** (no technical debt)
- **Performance optimized** (production-ready)
- **Well-tested** (high confidence)
- **Maintainable** (clean code)

---

## 📋 Pre-Implementation Checklist

Before writing any code, use extended thinking to answer these questions:

### For Each Component:
1. **What are the requirements?** (functional + non-functional)
2. **What are the edge cases?** (error scenarios, boundary conditions)
3. **What are the performance constraints?** (latency, memory, API costs)
4. **What are the dependencies?** (external APIs, libraries, services)
5. **How will this be tested?** (unit, integration, e2e)

---

## 🏗️ Implementation Order (Recommended)

### Phase 1: Backend Foundation (Week 1)

#### Step 1.1: Database Schema Design
**Extended Thinking Prompt**:
```
Design a PostgreSQL database schema for PipelineLab that supports:

Requirements:
1. Store pipeline configurations (nodes, edges, settings)
2. Store documents with extracted text
3. Store chunks with embeddings (pgvector)
4. Store evaluation results
5. Support efficient queries:
   - Find all pipelines by user
   - Vector similarity search on chunks
   - Retrieve chunks by document with pagination
   - Query evaluation history with filters

Consider:
- Normalization vs denormalization trade-offs
- Index strategies for performance
- JSONB vs separate tables for nested data
- Partitioning strategy for large datasets
- Migration strategy

Provide:
- Complete SQL schema with types
- Index definitions
- Foreign key constraints
- Sample queries with EXPLAIN plans
```

**Implementation**:
```bash
# After getting schema from extended thinking
cd backend
alembic init alembic
# Create migration with generated schema
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial schema"
alembic upgrade head
```

---

#### Step 1.2: FastAPI Project Structure
**Extended Thinking Prompt**:
```
Design an optimal FastAPI project structure for PipelineLab that:

```

**Implementation**:
```bash
